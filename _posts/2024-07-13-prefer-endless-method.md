### Introducing the Endless Method in Ruby 3.0

Ruby 3.0 introduces a new feature known as the endless method. This new feature simplifies method definitions by allowing developers to eliminate the traditional `end` keyword for closures, using a straightforward `=` instead. This is particularly useful for short, simple method definitions. For example:

**Traditional Syntax**

```ruby
def available?
  !@internal.empty?
end
```

**With Endless Method**

```ruby
def available? = !@internal.any?
```

### Streamline Your Codebase with My Synvert Snippet

To facilitate the transition to this new syntax, I've developed a Synvert snippet that automates the refactoring of existing method definitions to adopt the endless method format. You can find this snippet in the [Synvert Ruby snippets repository](https://github.com/synvert-hq/synvert-snippets-ruby/blob/main/lib/ruby/prefer-endless-method.rb).

The snippet intelligently scans Ruby files to identify and convert eligible traditional method definitions into their more concise endless method counterparts. It's designed to avoid inappropriate conversions such as those involving setter methods and parallel assignments, ensuring a safe and accurate transformation that maintains the original functionality of your code.

### Practical Example: Applying the Snippet

Let's explore how this snippet can be used on a real-world codebase. I will demonstrate the process on the `upgradecode.io` codebase.

**Running the Synvert Command**

Execute the following command to refactor your code:

```bash
synvert-ruby --run ruby/prefer-endless-method
```

Check the changes using:

```bash
git diff
```

Here's an example of the transformation in one of the project files:

```diff

**Ensuring Code Integrity Post-Refactoring**

After applying the snippet, it's crucial to verify the integrity and functionality of the code:

```bash
bundle exec rails test
```

### Conclusion

I hope this snippet facilitates your upgrade to Ruby 3.0 and helps streamline your codebase. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, I am eager to assist. Happy coding!
